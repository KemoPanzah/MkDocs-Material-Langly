# MkDocs Material Langly Plugin

The Langly plugin for MkDocs is a plugin that provides language support and translations for websites created with MkDocs using the Material theme. It enables easy management of multilingual content and automatic translation of texts to reach a wider audience. It deliberately does not comply with any of the current translation standards, but takes a completely unique but open approach.

This plugin was created to use the great Material theme and offers functionalities to e.g. internationalize the blog area.

**The only translation engine currently available is Deepl and a DeepL api key is required to use the plugin.**
